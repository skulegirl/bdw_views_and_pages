You shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless us (and each of our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from any claim, demand, action, damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out or relating to your use of our Services or alleging facts or circumstances that could constitute a breach of any provision of these Terms by you. If you are obligated to indemnify us, we will have the right, in our sole and unfettered discretion, to control any action or proceeding and determine whether we wish to settle it, and if so, on what terms.\\r\\n\\r\\n16. REPORTING MISCONDUCT. If you stay with or host anyone who you feel is acting or has acted inappropriately, including but not limited to offensive, violent or sexually inappropriate behavior, who steals from you or engages in any other disturbing conduct, you must immediately report such person to the appropriate authorities and to us by contacting us using the form at Contact Us and add as the title for your comment, \\"Problem with Another Member\\"; provided that your report shall not obligate us to take any action or cause us to incur any liability.\\r\\n\\r\\n17. MEETINGS. In-person meetings held by groups of interested members are not sponsored or organized by us. Members who organize meetings should make clear in their announcements, invitations and signage that their meetings have not been organized or approved, and are not run, by us. We cannot guarantee the quality, organization or safety of any in-person meeting (whether or not sponsored by us). Members attend meetings at their own risk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n18. LANGUAGES. The translation of any portion of this Site into another language is for your convenience only. Like any automated translation technology, the on-line third-party translation application used on this Site is susceptible to inaccuracy. You may rely only on the original, English-language version of this Site.\\r\\n\\r\\n19. DISPUTES. In the event a dispute arises between you and us, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means to resolve the dispute quickly. Accordingly, any claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of these Terms or our Services (\\"Claim\\") shall be resolved in accordance with one of the subsections below or as we may otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to these alternatives, we strongly encourage you to contact us directly to seek a resolution. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution (\\"ADR\\") procedures, such as mediation, as an alternative to litigation.\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) Binding Arbitration. For any Claim (excluding Claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand US Dollars (US$10,000), you or we may elect to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration conducted by telephone, on-line and/or based solely upon written submissions where no in-person appearance is required. In such cases, the arbitration shall be administered by the Canadian Arbitration Association in accordance with its applicable rules, or any other established ADR provider agreed upon by the parties. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) Court. Alternatively, any Claim may be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Ontario, Canada or where the defendant is located (in our case Ontario, Canada, and in your case your home address). You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a court located in Ontario, Canada or a Canadian federal court.\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) Alternative Dispute Resolution. Alternatively, we will consider use of other forms of ADR, such as binding arbitration to be held in Vermont, USA or another location agreed upon by the parties.\\r\\n\\r\\n(d) Attorney’s Fees. All Claims (excluding requests for injunctive or equitable relief) between the parties must be resolved using the dispute-resolution mechanism that is selected in accordance with this Section 19 by the first party to file a Claim. Should either party file an action contrary to this Section 19, the other party may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to US$5,000, provided that the party seeking the award has notified the other party in writing of the improperly filed Claim, and the other party has failed to withdraw the Claim.\\r\\n\\r\\n20. NOTICES. Any notices or other communications required or contemplated by these Terms shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) three (3) business days after being sent by certified or registered mail with return receipt, or (b) one (1) business day after being sent by reputable express courier service with tracking capability. Such notices shall be addressed to a party as follows, or to such other address as such party may designate by notice from time to time:\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) to us at\\r\\n\\r\\nBoondockers Welcome Inc.\\r\\nc/o Marianne Edwards\\r\\nBox 3023\\r\\nElora, Ontario\\r\\nCanada\\r\\nN0B 1S0\\r\\n\\r\\nand (b) to you, if you are a registered user, at the latest address you have provided in connection with your registration to use our Services.\\r\\n\\r\\n21. MISCELLANEOUS. These Terms shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of New Hampshire, USA without regard to conflict-of-law principles. These Terms contain the entire agreement, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, between the parties regarding their subject matter. Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under these Terms shall operate as a waiver thereof. The invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect. We may assign our agreement with you. Headings of sections are for convenience only and shall not be used to limit or construe such sections. Sections 1.5 (Release), 4 (Privacy), 5.1 (License), 6 (Third-Party Content), 7 (Proprietary Rights), 14 (Limits on Liability), 15 (Indemnity), 18 (Languages), 19 (Disputes), 20 (Notices) and this Section 21 (Miscellaneous) shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease<a target=\\"_blank\\" href=\\"http://www.boondockerswelcome.com/contact/contact-us\\"> Contact Us.</a> with any questions regarding these Terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour continued use of this Site and registration to use our Services is contingent upon your agreement to be bound by the foregoing Terms of Use.",

You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users of our Services. We will not be responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other users of our Services. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other users of our Services and to take any other action in good faith to restrict access to or the availability of any material that we or another user of our Services may consider obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable.</p>\\n<p>1.4 Release.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: \\"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\\"</p>\\n<p>2.

NO DATA, INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED BY YOU IN ORAL OR WRITTEN FORM FROM US OR THROUGH OR FROM OUR SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.</p>\\n<p>14. LIMITS ON LIABILITY</p>\\n<p>14.1. WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, GENERAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES) EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO: (A) THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE OUR SERVICES; (B) THE COST OF REPLACEMENT OF ANY GOODS, SERVICES OR INFORMATION PURCHASED OR OBTAINED AS A RESULT OF ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM OUR SERVICES; (C) DISCLOSURE OF, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT; (D) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR PROGRAMS, SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS OR PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES, EVEN IF WE KNOW OR HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; (E) STATEMENTS, CONDUCT OR OMISSIONS OF ANY SERVICE PROVIDERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTY ON OUR SERVICES; (F) YOUR OR ANYONE ELSE’S CONDUCT OR ACTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, BODILY INJURY, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, DEATH OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES RESULTING FROM COMMUNICATIONS OR MEETINGS WITH OTHER REGISTERED USERS OF OUR SERVICES OR PERSONS INTRODUCED TO YOU BY OUR SERVICES, WHETHER ON-LINE OR OFF-LINE; OR (G) ANY OTHER MATTER ARISING FROM, RELATING TO OR CONNECTED WITH OUR SERVICES OR THESE TERMS.</p>\\n<p>14.2.

ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF SECTIONS 13 AND 14 MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\\n<p>15. INDEMNITY. You shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless us (and each of our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from any claim, demand, action, damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out or relating to your use of our Services or alleging facts or circumstances that could constitute a breach of any provision of these Terms by you. If you are obligated to indemnify us, we will have the right, in our sole and unfettered discretion, to control any action or proceeding and determine whether we wish to settle it, and if so, on what terms.</p>\\n<p>16. REPORTING MISCONDUCT. If you stay with or host anyone who you feel is acting or has acted inappropriately, including but not limited to offensive, violent or sexually inappropriate behavior, who steals from you or engages in any other disturbing conduct, you must immediately report such person to the appropriate authorities and to us by contacting us using the form at Contact Us and add as the title for your comment, \\"Problem with Another Member\\"; provided that your report shall not obligate us to take any action or cause us to incur any liability.</p>\\n<p>17. MEETINGS. In-person meetings held by groups of interested members are not sponsored or organized by us. Members who organize meetings should make clear in their announcements, invitations and signage that their meetings have not been organized or approved, and are not run, by us. We cannot guarantee the quality, organization or safety of any in-person meeting (whether or not sponsored by us). Members attend meetings at their own risk.</p>\\n<p>18. LANGUAGES. The translation of any portion of this Site into another language is for your convenience only. Like any automated translation technology, the on-line third-party translation application used on this Site is susceptible to inaccuracy. You may rely only on the original, English-language version of this Site.</p>\\n<p>19. DISPUTES. In the event a dispute arises between you and us, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means to resolve the dispute quickly. Accordingly, any claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of these Terms or our Services (\\"Claim\\") shall be resolved in accordance with one of the subsections below or as we may otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to these alternatives, we strongly encourage you to contact us directly to seek a resolution. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution (\\"ADR\\") procedures, such as mediation, as an alternative to litigation.</p>\\n<p>(a) Binding Arbitration. For any Claim (excluding Claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand US Dollars (US$10,000), you or we may elect to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration conducted by telephone, on-line and/or based solely upon written submissions where no in-person appearance is required. In such cases, the arbitration shall be administered by the Canadian Arbitration Association in accordance with its applicable rules, or any other established ADR provider agreed upon by the parties. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\\n<p>(b) Court. Alternatively, any Claim may be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Ontario, Canada or where the defendant is located (in our case Ontario, Canada, and in your case your home address). You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a court located in Ontario, Canada or a Canadian federal court.</p>\\n<p>(c) Alternative Dispute Resolution. Alternatively, we will consider use of other forms of ADR, such as binding arbitration to be held in Vermont, USA or another location agreed upon by the parties.</p>\\n<p>(d) Attorney’s Fees. All Claims (excluding requests for injunctive or equitable relief) between the parties must be resolved using the dispute-resolution mechanism that is selected in accordance with this Section 19 by the first party to file a Claim. Should either party file an action contrary to this Section 19, the other party may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to US$5,000, provided that the party seeking the award has notified the other party in writing of the improperly filed Claim, and the other party has failed to withdraw the Claim.</p>\\n<p>20. NOTICES. Any notices or other communications required or contemplated by these Terms shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) three (3) business days after being sent by certified or registered mail with return receipt, or (b) one (1) business day after being sent by reputable express courier service with tracking capability. Such notices shall be addressed to a party as follows, or to such other address as such party may designate by notice from time to time:</p>\\n<p>(a) to us at</p>\\n<p>Boondockers Welcome Inc.<br />\\nc/o Marianne Edwards<br />\\nBox 3023<br />\\nElora, Ontario<br />\\nCanada<br />\\nN0B 1S0</p>\\n<p>and (b) to you, if you are a registered user, at the latest address you have provided in connection with your registration to use our Services.</p>\\n<p>21. MISCELLANEOUS. These Terms shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of New Hampshire, USA without regard to conflict-of-law principles. These Terms contain the entire agreement, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, between the parties regarding their subject matter. Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under these Terms shall operate as a waiver thereof. The invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect. We may assign our agreement with you. Headings of sections are for convenience only and shall not be used to limit or construe such sections. Sections 1.5 (Release), 4 (Privacy), 5.1 (License), 6 (Third-Party Content), 7 (Proprietary Rights), 14 (Limits on Liability), 15 (Indemnity), 18 (Languages), 19 (Disputes), 20 (Notices) and this Section 21 (Miscellaneous) shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms.</p>\\n<p>Please<a target=\\"_blank\\" href=\\"http://www.boondockerswelcome.com/contact/contact-us\\"> Contact Us.</a> with any questions regarding these Terms.</p>\\n<p>Your continued use of this Site and registration to use our Services is contingent upon your agreement to be bound by the foregoing Terms of Use.</p>\\n",

            \'value\' => "<ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p> <strong>What is Boondocking?</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Boondocking (or dry camping) refers to staying in an RV in a remote location without being hooked up to water, power, or sewer. Most RVers spend at least some nights parked without hook-ups, if only while traveling between destinations. Parking overnight at a truck stop, rest area, or Walmart parking lot is common. This is sometimes referred to as \\"blacktop boondocking.\\" </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p> <strong>What is the cost of membership?</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Memberships fees are listed  <a target=\\"_blank\\" href=\\"https://www.boondockerswelcome.com/membership-products\\">here. </a>   </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p> <strong>I\'m not too comfortable with just inviting myself over or asking to stay on someone else\'s property.</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Members of the Boondockers Welcome community have signed up with the intention of hosting other RVers. By joining the club and posting a profile with boondocking available, they are extending the invitation to you. You are not inviting yourself over. Many RVers who cannot travel as often as they like would love the opportunity to host fellow RVers, especially because there\'s really no work involved in simply providing a parking space.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n <li><p> <strong>So, will I let just anyone park in my driveway?</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>No. Privacy and security are a high priority at Boondockers Welcome.com. All email addresses are kept strictly confidential and we do not permit your exact physical address or exact directions to your location on your profile page. You can only be contacted by other registered members and only through the web site. You\'ll be able to see the profile of the person who has submitted a request and, sometimes, references from previous hosts. If you don\'t like what you see, you can reply that you don\'t have a spot at this time or, if you prefer, state your true reason for declining. All messages between members are secure and private. It is up to the host to reveal his or her address to a potential guest. We just do the introductions. Hosts can acquaint themselves with potential guests through messages for as long as they like before agreeing to accommodate them. You are not obligated in any way to accommodate anyone. At Boondockers Welcome.com you are in control. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>How do I find a friendly driveway where I can park for a night along my travel route?</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Once you\'ve decided the general direction and route you plan to travel, check the map for members who may have a boondocking spot available along the way. To the left of the map, you can click on the member\'s user name to see their profile details and communicate with them by sending a message through the web site. We forward your message on to them immediately (by email) and they can respond the same way.  For best results, make your initial contact and inquiry early but  don\'t \\"reserve\\" or arrange for your boondocking spot any more than three weeks in advance (generally, people don\'t know what they\'ll be doing in three weeks time). Don\'t wait until the last minute if you can avoid it - some people don\'t check email messages regularly. As a rule of thumb, three to four days notice works best for most hosts but read the profile to see if there\'s a preference listed. Feel free to exchange phone numbers for easier contact once you\'re both comfortable doing so.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p> <strong>My RV is 40 feet long. Is there a way to filter results to show only the boondocking locations that can accommodate my rig? </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Absolutely. Use the \\"Search by Location\\" feature under the \\"Find Boondocking\\" tab. After determining the area you want to find boondocking in, check mark the appropriate box for \\"size of boondocking space.\\" You can also filter results based on whether pets are welcome, generators may be used, and several other search parameters. To see all locations in one state, province, territory, or country, simply choose a central city or town and set a radius of enough miles around it to include the area you want.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p> <strong>I\'ve contacted a host member with a request but haven\'t heard back yet. How long should I wait before I contact my second choice? </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You may hear back immediately or it could take several days. All our members are RVers and may be traveling and not always able to check email. You\'re welcome to contact more than one host at a time in case your first choice isn\'t available. We ask hosts and guests alike to please show common courtesy; reply to all messages as soon as possible, even if only to say you\'ll need more details or some time to think about it. If you don\'t get a response at all, you may<a target=\\"_blank\\" href=\\"http://www.boondockerswelcome.com/contact/contact-us\\"> contact us</a> with the member\'s user name. If we believe a host is ignoring all requests, we\'ll contact them to find out why, update their availabilty, or change their status. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>I\'d like to join but I\'m not sure how many of your hosts can accommodate my size of rig? Also, how many of them welcome pets?</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The specific number changes as the site grows but there\'s a simple way to see how many hosts we currently have that can accommodate your needs. Choose \\"Search by Location\\" and enter a central city (i.e. Denver, Colorado). Set a large search radius (i.e. 5000 miles) to encompass all locations in North America. In the drop-down box, choose the size of parking spot that will fit your rig. (You can filter by whether pets are welcome and several other factors as well). This brings up many pages of results so, at the bottom of the screen, go to the last page. There are 10 results shown per page so multiply the number of pages by 10 and you\'ll have the total number of host locations that can accommodate your needs. If you like, click on any of the results on these pages to see more details about each location. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>  We aren\'t home for many months of the year. How many nights per year must I offer a boondocking space to other RVers in order to qualify as a member with boondocking available? </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As long as you actually have a parking space available some of the time, even if it\'s limited to a small class B (camper van) or truck camper, there\'s no requirement to host more frequently than is convenient for you. One year you may be able to host several months and, the next year, you may be traveling yourself and not have any dates available. You will not be requested to change your membership status unless your calendar is NEVER open for guests. If you don\'t want to host other RVers, simply join as a member without boondocking available.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong> I\'d love to host other RVers but I\'m not sure my neighbors would be happy to to see someone \\"living\\" in my driveway.</strong> </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If you\'re concerned about the neighbors, be sure to limit the number of times you host and the length of stay. On the \\"boondocking available\\" page of your profile, you can list any restrictions you like, ask guests to refrain from using awnings, slide-outs, barbecues, lawn chairs, generators, or  request that all music and lights are turned off at a certain time. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>I live in a popular tourist area. I\'d like to host a few times a year but I\'m afraid I\'ll be inundated with too many requests.</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You can stipulate this concern in the availability section of your profile and also let people know you will only respond to the requests you can accommodate. Change your availability information as often as you wish. You\'re never obligated to host anyone. If it becomes a real issue, you can even turn off the email notification feature and simply check in for messages at your convenience. Wouldn\'t YOU like to have a spot to park in popular areas yourself when you travel? If you\'re upfront about it in your profile, members will understand your dilemma and feel lucky and grateful should you choose to host them. </p>\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>I can\'t currently host anyone. Can I still register as a member with boondocking available?</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You may register as a member without boondocking available and, when your situation changes, you can simply change the status of your profile. </p>\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p> <strong> I can\'t offer a spot but I know the Walmart in my town allows overnight parking. Can I join as a member with boondocking available and list the Walmart location?</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sorry - this site is for listing only boondocking locations on private property - ones that are privately owned or controlled by the members who list them. There are several other web sites where you can share your other boondocking discoveries.\\r\\n  </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>  Can I choose which age-group I\'d prefer to host?</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p> This web site is only about introducing you to other RVers with similar interests. It\'s totally up to you who you wish to host. Whenever you receive a request, you choose which criteria they need to meet. You may decline them if they aren\'t what you\'re looking for in a guest. However, so as not to waste other people\'s time as well as your own, we encourage you to specify your preferences when you register. You can update this information in your profile as often as you wish.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>I may not check my email daily. Maybe members can connect by texting or a phone call instead?</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We recommend that members do not list their phone number or email address directly on their profile but use the web site\'s secure messaging feature for making that first contact. This also gives the prospective host the opportunity to review the guest\'s profile before committing. Once both parties are comfortable with doing so, by all means, exchange phone numbers.</p>\\r\\n  \\r\\n <li><p> <strong>May I join if I travel in a tent trailer? </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Only if you are set up to be totally self-sufficient. Even then, some of our hosts may have to decline your request. Most only accept self-contained RVs with toilet facilities and holding tanks. In an urban setting, they may be concerned about appearances as well and, therefore, decline your request. </p>\\r\\n<li><p><strong> Does Boondockers Welcome sell or share my personal details?</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>No. All of your details are required solely to allow the site to function and for informational feedback for the web site administrators alone. That\'s us, Marianne Edwards and Anna Maste. Other members will only see your chosen user name, nearest city, and country. They will not have access to your full name, physical address, email address, or phone number, unless you give it to them expressly. All your account contact information is only for our eyes and will not be shared or exploited for any reason. We strongly suggest that you do not add your email address or phone number to the profile pages. Those pages of the web site are visible to the general public and members can contact you without that information. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>Why should I use a nickname rather than my full name when I register? </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You\'re welcome to submit your full name when you become a member, making it easier for RVing friends you already know to identify you. We only suggest using a nickname as an extra privacy feature. If you are listed by your full name and home town, it may be possible for anyone (member or not) to find your phone number and address in the local phone directory and then, without first contacting you, show up on your doorstep expecting a place to park. We aren\'t trying to limit your contact with other members for any reason other than to protect your privacy. As soon as you\'ve been \\"introduced\\" through the site, we encourage you to exchange full contact information. Once you\'ve met each other and probably become friends, you certainly don\'t need to make contact through our web site for subsequent visits. Of course, the web site remains the best way to find new contacts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong> We hosted a lovely couple in our driveway. How can I post a recommendation for them? </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p> After a successful boondocking experience, both hosts and guests are encouraged to add recommendations for each other. Post it in the right-hand column of the fellow member\'s profile.  In doing so, it\'s important not to divulge any identifying personal or location information that is not already provided on their page. If the member has used a nickname, refer to him/her only by that name. You will be notified when someone adds a recommendation about you. Please read it immediately and contact us if you want anything deleted or changed. References between members may serve as an introduction and help put minds at ease for future stays.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong> We got a request from a member who has very little information on their profile. We\'re reluctant to respond.</strong></p> \\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Every member is asked to fill out a <i>Personal Profile.</i> This is where you reveal  enough information about yourself so fellow members can decide whether to welcome you as a guest or choose you as a host. We understand some people are reluctant to share personal details and photos online. All fields are optional so it\'s up to you what you choose to share. If you decide not to provide much detail, however, we suggest you give it in the initial message you send to a fellow member. Those messages are forwarded securely through email and not made public. If you don\'t reveal enough about yourself, you may not get a response. We encourage you to ask for specifics from fellow members (via private messages through the site) before agreeing to a stay. This may include their real name, address, phone number, etc. - whatever will make you feel comfortable.  </p>\\r\\n  \\r\\n<li><p><strong>  As a host, how accommodating do I have to be? For instance, I work long hours and, although I don\'t mind providing a parking space, I often don\'t have the time or energy at the end of the day to entertain anyone.</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p> The bare minimum that guests expect is a free place to park for at least one night. Because RVers are so used to being self-sufficient, you can even explain through your messages exactly where you would like them to park and, if you\'re comfortable with it, your guests could arrive late and leave again in the morning without ever meeting you in person. On the other hand, some hosts enjoy the social aspect so much that they invite guests into their home to use the shower and laundry or share a meal. Others might even offer to be a personal tour guide for some of the local attractions. Circumstances change. If you do extra for one guest, you don\'t have to do the same for everyone. Remember, too, that your guests may prefer to do things on their own or they may be on a travel schedule and are only interested in a brief stop-over so be sure to respect their wishes. It\'s up to both host and guest to convey their expectations in advance. \\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong> How do I make changes to the information on my profile or change my user name, email address, or password?</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\nLog in and click on the \\"my account\\" tab (it appears on the top tool bar only after you are logged in). \\r\\n\\r\\nChoose from the tabs, \\"user profile, boondocking available, or account info\\". Make your changes and scroll to the bottom of the page to click \\"save\\". We forward messages from other members to you at the email address you registered with so it\'s important to update it if there is a change.\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><Strong>The balloon location on the map is about 10 miles off from where we actually live. How can I put it in the correct location?</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The generalized map location is done for your protection, so that other users cannot find you without first making contact and being invited to stay. If you want to be more specific about your location you can add further details into the description section of your \\"Boondocking Available\\" section, giving people a better idea of where you\'re located but please don\'t list the exact address or precise directions. This is to protect you, the property owner, from having guests arrive without permission or without your knowledge.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>I travel to some destinations where I\'d like to spend a week rather than a day or two. Should I plan to book a campground instead or move on to stay with a different club member if there is one in the same area? I wouldn\'t want to overstay my welcome. </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Most hosts will specify in their profile how many nights in a row they are willing to let you park. Of course, once you get to know each other, things might change. In all cases, unless the host expressly invites you to stay on longer, it would not be polite to ask. Move on instead to another nearby member, a local campground, or a Walmart parking lot but not before showing your profound appreciation to your host.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>Is it okay to ask a host to plug in to electric power or fill up my fresh water tank? </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Unless your host has posted these options on his profile or voluntarily offers them to you, it is not polite to ask for any \\"extras\\" that would only serve to put your host \\"on the spot.\\" Your job as a guest is to be super polite and considerate. If you\'ve boondocked at a lot of member locations and still have not one good reference posted to your profile on the member web site, you might need to ask yourself why.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>I like to \\"blow with the wind\\" and not make plans too far in advance. If I contact a member and request a place to park, I\'m afraid he\'ll be offended if my plans take me in a differerent direction and I change my mind.</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Since we\'re all RVers, most hosts will be totally understanding. Just don\'t leave them wondering or waiting for your arrival before you cancel - give them as much notice as possible. For this reason, it\'s in the interest of both host and guest to exchange phone numbers before the arrival date. If you find this happens to you often, consider letting the host know in advance of the likelihood or list it in your profile so hosts can decide whether you\'re someone they want to accommodate or not. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>What if I have guests that show up with a larger RV than I specified or ignore the requests and restrictions that I posted on my profile?</strong> </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If that should happen, it is probably a misunderstanding. The guest may have read the profiles of several potential hosts and forgotten which was yours. In any case, as a host, you are not obligated to follow through even after you have agreed to let someone stay and they\'ve driven out of their way for miles and miles to get to you. It\'s a good idea to remind your guests of the \\"rules\\" through your communication prior to arrival, especially if there are several important ones. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you do encounter a situation or a member who is obviously rude or negligent, please <a target=\\"_blank\\" href=\\"http://www.boondockerswelcome.com/contact/contact-us\\">contact us.</a> We take all complaints seriously and will cancel memberships, if necessary. Our policy is: first complaint, we\'ll make a note, second complaint, give a warning, and third complaint, revoke membership.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>Am I liable if someone falls or hurts themselves on my property? What if they sue me? </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p> Liability is a local issue. Depending on the state or country where you live, as a property owner, you may be liable if someone gets hurt on your property - period, no matter who it is or the reason they are there. A property owner is always open for civil suits by both invited or non-invited parties. Even posting a \\"no trespassing\\" sign won\'t necessarily protect you if an intruder is hurt. Most house insurance policies, however, include a clause to cover you for this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>I operate a small campground. Can I list it as a boondocking location on this web site? </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Not unless you offer free camping. The Boondockers Welcome web site is only intended for listing free overnight parking on property owned or controlled by its members. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>How can I search by state? The \\"Search by Location\\" tab doesn\'t seem to work. </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To see all locations in one state, province, territory, or country, under the \\"Search by Location\\" tab, simply choose a central city or town and set a radius of enough miles around it to include the area you want.  The \\"Search by Location\\" feature is set up to search for cities or towns all over the world. When you only enter a state name, it looks for a city or town by that name instead.  Because town names are sometimes repeated in various states, and countries, you should also specify the state or province.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong>May I ask guests to pay for electricity? </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Although all we ask hosts to provide is overnight parking, many generously include water and electric hookups. If you want to be compensated for the cost, it\'s a good idea to mention that on your profile and negotiate the rate upfront.  \\r\\n </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<li><p><strong> I want to make a change to my profile. How can I do this? </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Log in and click on the \\"my account\\" tab (on the top tool bar).

Most RVers spend at least some nights parked without hook-ups, if only while traveling between destinations. Parking overnight at a truck stop, rest area, or Walmart parking lot is common. This is sometimes referred to as \\"blacktop boondocking.\\" </p>\\n</li><li> <strong>What is the cost of membership?</strong>\\n<p>Memberships fees are listed  <a target=\\"_blank\\" href=\\"https://www.boondockerswelcome.com/membership-products\\">here. </a>   </p>\\n</li><li> <strong>I\'m not too comfortable with just inviting myself over or asking to stay on someone else\'s property.</strong>\\n<p>Members of the Boondockers Welcome community have signed up with the intention of hosting other RVers. By joining the club and posting a profile with boondocking available, they are extending the invitation to you. You are not inviting yourself over. Many RVers who cannot travel as often as they like would love the opportunity to host fellow RVers, especially because there\'s really no work involved in simply providing a parking space.</p>\\n</li><li> <strong>So, will I let just anyone park in my driveway?</strong>\\n<p>No. Privacy and security are a high priority at Boondockers Welcome.com. All email addresses are kept strictly confidential and we do not permit your exact physical address or exact directions to your location on your profile page. You can only be contacted by other registered members and only through the web site. You\'ll be able to see the profile of the person who has submitted a request and, sometimes, references from previous hosts. If you don\'t like what you see, you can reply that you don\'t have a spot at this time or, if you prefer, state your true reason for declining. All messages between members are secure and private. It is up to the host to reveal his or her address to a potential guest. We just do the introductions. Hosts can acquaint themselves with potential guests through messages for as long as they like before agreeing to accommodate them. You are not obligated in any way to accommodate anyone. At Boondockers Welcome.com you are in control. </p>\\n</li><li><strong>How do I find a friendly driveway where I can park for a night along my travel route?</strong>\\n<p>Once you\'ve decided the general direction and route you plan to travel, check the map for members who may have a boondocking spot available along the way. To the left of the map, you can click on the member\'s user name to see their profile details and communicate with them by sending a message through the web site. We forward your message on to them immediately (by email) and they can respond the same way.  For best results, make your initial contact and inquiry early but  don\'t \\"reserve\\" or arrange for your boondocking spot any more than three weeks in advance (generally, people don\'t know what they\'ll be doing in three weeks time). Don\'t wait until the last minute if you can avoid it - some people don\'t check email messages regularly. As a rule of thumb, three to four days notice works best for most hosts but read the profile to see if there\'s a preference listed. Feel free to exchange phone numbers for easier contact once you\'re both comfortable doing so.</p>\\n</li><li> <strong>My RV is 40 feet long. Is there a way to filter results to show only the boondocking locations that can accommodate my rig? </strong>\\n<p>Absolutely. Use the \\"Search by Location\\" feature under the \\"Find Boondocking\\" tab. After determining the area you want to find boondocking in, check mark the appropriate box for \\"size of boondocking space.\\" You can also filter results based on whether pets are welcome, generators may be used, and several other search parameters. To see all locations in one state, province, territory, or country, simply choose a central city or town and set a radius of enough miles around it to include the area you want.</p>\\n</li><li> <strong>I\'ve contacted a host member with a request but haven\'t heard back yet. How long should I wait before I contact my second choice? </strong>\\n<p>You may hear back immediately or it could take several days. All our members are RVers and may be traveling and not always able to check email. You\'re welcome to contact more than one host at a time in case your first choice isn\'t available. We ask hosts and guests alike to please show common courtesy; reply to all messages as soon as possible, even if only to say you\'ll need more details or some time to think about it. If you don\'t get a response at all, you may<a target=\\"_blank\\" href=\\"http://www.boondockerswelcome.com/contact/contact-us\\"> contact us</a> with the member\'s user name. If we believe a host is ignoring all requests, we\'ll contact them to find out why, update their availabilty, or change their status. </p>\\n</li><li><strong>I\'d like to join but I\'m not sure how many of your hosts can accommodate my size of rig? Also, how many of them welcome pets?</strong>\\n<p>The specific number changes as the site grows but there\'s a simple way to see how many hosts we currently have that can accommodate your needs. Choose \\"Search by Location\\" and enter a central city (i.e. Denver, Colorado). Set a large search radius (i.e. 5000 miles) to encompass all locations in North America. In the drop-down box, choose the size of parking spot that will fit your rig. (You can filter by whether pets are welcome and several other factors as well). This brings up many pages of results so, at the bottom of the screen, go to the last page. There are 10 results shown per page so multiply the number of pages by 10 and you\'ll have the total number of host locations that can accommodate your needs. If you like, click on any of the results on these pages to see more details about each location. </p>\\n</li><li><strong>  We aren\'t home for many months of the year. How many nights per year must I offer a boondocking space to other RVers in order to qualify as a member with boondocking available? </strong>\\n<p>As long as you actually have a parking space available some of the time, even if it\'s limited to a small class B (camper van) or truck camper, there\'s no requirement to host more frequently than is convenient for you. One year you may be able to host several months and, the next year, you may be traveling yourself and not have any dates available. You will not be requested to change your membership status unless your calendar is NEVER open for guests. If you don\'t want to host other RVers, simply join as a member without boondocking available.</p>\\n</li><li><strong> I\'d love to host other RVers but I\'m not sure my neighbors would be happy to to see someone \\"living\\" in my driveway.</strong>\\n<p>If you\'re concerned about the neighbors, be sure to limit the number of times you host and the length of stay. On the \\"boondocking available\\" page of your profile, you can list any restrictions you like, ask guests to refrain from using awnings, slide-outs, barbecues, lawn chairs, generators, or  request that all music and lights are turned off at a certain time. </p>\\n</li><li><strong>I live in a popular tourist area. I\'d like to host a few times a year but I\'m afraid I\'ll be inundated with too many requests.</strong>\\n<p>You can stipulate this concern in the availability section of your profile and also let people know you will only respond to the requests you can accommodate. Change your availability information as often as you wish. You\'re never obligated to host anyone. If it becomes a real issue, you can even turn off the email notification feature and simply check in for messages at your convenience. Wouldn\'t YOU like to have a spot to park in popular areas yourself when you travel? If you\'re upfront about it in your profile, members will understand your dilemma and feel lucky and grateful should you choose to host them. </p>\\n</li><li><strong>I can\'t currently host anyone. Can I still register as a member with boondocking available?</strong>\\n<p>You may register as a member without boondocking available and, when your situation changes, you can simply change the status of your profile. </p>\\n</li><li> <strong> I can\'t offer a spot but I know the Walmart in my town allows overnight parking. Can I join as a member with boondocking available and list the Walmart location?</strong>\\n<p>Sorry - this site is for listing only boondocking locations on private property - ones that are privately owned or controlled by the members who list them. There are several other web sites where you can share your other boondocking discoveries.</p>\\n</li><li><strong>  Can I choose which age-group I\'d prefer to host?</strong>\\n<p> This web site is only about introducing you to other RVers with similar interests.

It\'s a good idea to remind your guests of the \\"rules\\" through your communication prior to arrival, especially if there are several important ones. </p>\\n<p>If you do encounter a situation or a member who is obviously rude or negligent, please <a target=\\"_blank\\" href=\\"http://www.boondockerswelcome.com/contact/contact-us\\">contact us.</a> We take all complaints seriously and will cancel memberships, if necessary. Our policy is: first complaint, we\'ll make a note, second complaint, give a warning, and third complaint, revoke membership.</p>\\n</li><li><strong>Am I liable if someone falls or hurts themselves on my property? What if they sue me? </strong>\\n<p> Liability is a local issue. Depending on the state or country where you live, as a property owner, you may be liable if someone gets hurt on your property - period, no matter who it is or the reason they are there. A property owner is always open for civil suits by both invited or non-invited parties. Even posting a \\"no trespassing\\" sign won\'t necessarily protect you if an intruder is hurt. Most house insurance policies, however, include a clause to cover you for this.</p>\\n</li><li><strong>I operate a small campground. Can I list it as a boondocking location on this web site? </strong>\\n<p>Not unless you offer free camping. The Boondockers Welcome web site is only intended for listing free overnight parking on property owned or controlled by its members. </p>\\n</li><li><strong>How can I search by state? The \\"Search by Location\\" tab doesn\'t seem to work. </strong>\\n<p>To see all locations in one state, province, territory, or country, under the \\"Search by Location\\" tab, simply choose a central city or town and set a radius of enough miles around it to include the area you want.  The \\"Search by Location\\" feature is set up to search for cities or towns all over the world. When you only enter a state name, it looks for a city or town by that name instead.  Because town names are sometimes repeated in various states, and countries, you should also specify the state or province.</p>\\n</li><li><strong>May I ask guests to pay for electricity? </strong>\\n<p>Although all we ask hosts to provide is overnight parking, many generously include water and electric hookups. If you want to be compensated for the cost, it\'s a good idea to mention that on your profile and negotiate the rate upfront.  </p>\\n</li><li><strong> I want to make a change to my profile. How can I do this? </strong>\\n<p>Log in and click on the \\"my account\\" tab (on the top tool bar). Choose from the tabs to change any information you wish on your account or your profile. Be sure to scroll to the bottom of the page and click \\"save\\" to make the changes take effect.</p>\\n</li></ol><p><strong>More questions?
